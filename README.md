For my honour's thesis during final year at UBC 2023/24, I explore the field of quantum information by constructing a quantum algorithm for the bottleneck travelling salesman problem (BTSP).

In the proposal folder you can find the initial idea of using a combination of phase estimation and grover's algorithm. This strategy has now been altered and only the phase estimation algorithm is needed.

The tests folder contain jupyter notebooks for solving the BTSP for various cases. More details are contained within each notebook.

The quantum circuit for a single Hamiltonian cycle to solve the decision problem of the BTSP:
