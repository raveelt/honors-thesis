\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces A quantum circuit representation of the phase estimation algorithm. Given, $ U |\lambda \rangle = e^{2\pi i \phi } |\lambda \rangle $, this algorithm allows us to generate an approximation for $\phi \in [0,1)$ . The circuit consists of two registers of qubits, the first $n$-qubits are initialized to $|0\rangle $ and contribute to the precision of the $\phi $ value obtained. The second register of $m$-qubits is initialized to the eigenstate of $U$. The Hadamard gates, $H$, are used to create a uniform superposition in the first register. The control gates based on $U$ are responsible for encoding phase to the qubits in the first register. Finally, a $QFT^\dagger $ is performed on the first register to extract the encoded phase. Each subsequent qubit in the first register would require double the control gates. Thus, with a large $n$ we obtain a more precise value for $\phi $, but also exponentially increase our computation time.}}{6}{figure.2.2}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces the quantum circuit for the BTSP: 3 qubit phase estimation is performed measuring the hamiltonian cycle $A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow A$, using the corresponding eigenstate is $|01101100\rangle $. Due to Qiskit convention on qubit ordering, the eigentate is initialized in reverse. The CU gate denotes the control unitary matrix containing all the hamiltonian cycles. The CU' gate inhabits the same cycles but before it was constructed, all edgeweights not satisfying the constraint, $\geq \alpha $, were set to zero. We have two sets of 3 qubits to be measured and stored in to classical registers labelled 'output' and 'output c'.}}{20}{figure.4.1}%
