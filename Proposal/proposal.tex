		\section{Motivation}
		
		
		Recent advancements in quantum computing have opened up new frontiers in solving complex computational problems that were previously considered intractable using classical methods. The Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP), a quintessential example of combinatorial optimization, stands as a formidable challenge in the field of logistics and operations research. Its practical applications range from optimizing delivery routes to circuit design, making its efficient solution a subject of paramount importance.
		
		This research proposal embarks on a pioneering journey at the intersection of quantum computing and combinatorial optimization by introducing a quantum algorithm tailored to address the BTSP. The BTSP requires finding the shortest closed tour through a set of cities while minimizing the largest cost (the "bottleneck") along any route. Its computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of cities, rendering classical solutions impractical for large-scale instances.
		
		Our approach capitalizes on the inherent quantum parallelism and superposition principles, as well as the unique feature of phase encoding in quantum computing. By exploiting these quantum phenomena, we aim to encode and manipulate the costs associated with various routes efficiently. Additionally, the utilization of generalized Grover's search algorithm as a central component of our quantum approach is poised to significantly expedite the search for the optimal solution.
		
		In this letter, we present a succinct yet comprehensive overview of our research proposal, highlighting the theoretical foundation of the quantum algorithm, its potential computational advantages over classical methods, and its practical implications for solving real-world instances of the BTSP. This proposal underscores our commitment to bridging the gap between quantum theory and practical optimization, offering a glimpse into the potential impact of quantum computing on route optimization, logistics, and transportation.
		
		The following sections will detail the key components of our quantum algorithm, its expected computational complexity, and the significance of its implementation, underscoring its potential to reshape how we approach complex combinatorial optimization problems.
		
		
		\section{Theory}
		
		\subsection{Bottleneck Travelling Salesman}
		The BTSP can be represented as a graph problem.  We start with a graph, whose vertices are labelled A through D, representing a 4-city system. We define movement from one vertex to another as a walk, done through the edges connecting our vertices. We are interested in a particular walk known as a hamiltonian cycle that contains every vertex extactly once before returning to the start ($A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C\rightarrow D \rightarrow A$). Our graph also includes edge weights, we define as $ \gamma_i $.
		The BTSP is to find the hamiltonian cycle in a graph, where the largest edge weight ("bottleneck") is minimized. This is distinct from the TSP where the combined edge weights in a given cycle is minimized. The total possible hamiltonian cycles is given by $(N-1)!$, where N is the number of nodes. We present a symmetric case in the figure,  $N_k \rightarrow N_{k+1} = N_{k+1} \rightarrow N_{k} = \gamma_i$. Thus the total possible cycles is  $(N-1)!/2$.  It is important to note that a solution to either BTSP or TSP is not unique. BTSP solutions also do not nessesarily equate to the TSP solutions. We can illustrate an example with the help of our figure. 
		
		consider all the hamiltonian cycles for a symmetric 4-city system:
		
		
		$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow A $
		
		$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow C \rightarrow A $ 
		
		$ A \rightarrow C \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow A $
		
		assigning some arbritrary weights, we can see the total costs of the cycles below:
		
		$\gamma_1 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_3 = 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 17$
		
		$ \gamma_1 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_2 = 4 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 17$
		
		$  \gamma_2 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_3 = 2 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 16$
