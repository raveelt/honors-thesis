		\section{Motivation}
		
		
		Continuous advancements in quantum computing have opened up new ways to solve complex computational problems that were previously considered intractable using classical methods. The Bottleneck Traveling Salesman Problem (BTSP), is a good example of an optimization problem that stands as a challenge in the field of logistics and operations research (need ref). Its practical applications range from optimizing delivery routes to circuit design (need ref). As a result, achieving an efficient solution is highly sought after.
		
		We embark on a journey at the intersection of quantum computing and optimization by introducing a quantum algorithm tailored to address the BTSP. It requires finding the shortest closed tour through a set of cities while minimizing the largest cost (the "bottleneck") along any route. Its computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of cities (need ref), rendering classical solutions impractical for large-scale instances.
		
		Our approach is to capitalize on the inherent quantum parallelism, as well as the unique feature of phase encoding in quantum computing. By exploiting these phenomena, we aim to encode and manipulate the costs associated with various routes efficiently. Additionally, the utilization of Grover's search algorithm as a central component of our quantum approach significantly expedites the search for the optimal solution.
		
		In this proposal, our primary objective is to shed light on the theoretical foundation of the quantum algorithm, its potential computational advantages over classical methods. Through this research, we aim to work towards a clear understanding of these aspects. The following sections will detail the BTSP, its expected computational complexity, Grover's algorithm and the significance of its implementation.
		
		\textbf{This section in the examples was typically a page, needs more substance. Maybe elaborating on the practical examples a little more. Dont love last paragraph} 
		
		
		\section{Theory}
		
		\subsection{Bottleneck Travelling Salesman Problem}

			\includegraphics[trim={0 0 21.9cm 0},clip, width=0.7 \linewidth]{"graphics/4-city graphic"}
			\caption{An undirected weighted graph represention of a  symmetric 4-city system.  The vertices represent cities and the edge weights represent the cost of travel. }
			\label{fig:4-city-graphic}
		\end{figure}		
		
		
		
		
		The BTSP can be represented as a graph problem.  We start with a graph, whose vertices are labelled A through D, representing a 4-city system. We define movement from one vertex to another as a walk, done through the edges connecting our vertices. We are interested in a particular walk known as a hamiltonian cycle that contains every vertex extactly once before returning to the start. Our graph also includes edge weights, we define as $ \gamma_i $.
		The BTSP is to find the hamiltonian cycle in a graph, where the largest edge weight ("bottleneck") is minimized. This is distinct from the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) where the combined edge weights in a given cycle is minimized. The total possible hamiltonian cycles is given by $(N-1)!$, where N is the number of nodes. We present a symmetric case in the figure,  $N_k \rightarrow N_{k+1} = N_{k+1} \rightarrow N_{k} = \gamma_i$. Thus the total possible cycles is  $(N-1)!/2$.  It is important to note that a solution to either BTSP or TSP is not unique. BTSP solutions also do not nessesarily equate to the TSP solutions. We can illustrate an example with the help of our figure. Consider all the hamiltonian cycles for a symmetric 4-city system:
		
		\textbf{the discussion of hamiltonian cycles within the paragraph could maybe be a little more formal? seperating the math from the paragraph?} 
		
		\begin{center}
		$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow A $
		
		$ A \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow C \rightarrow A $ 
		
		$ A \rightarrow C \rightarrow B \rightarrow D \rightarrow A $
	    \end{center}
		
		Assigning some arbritrary weights, we can see the total costs of the cycles below. The first cycle is the solution to BTSP as its largest edge weight at $5$ is the smallest among all three. The last cycle is a solution to the TSP as its combined edge weight is the smallest.
		\begin{center}
		$\gamma_1 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_3 = 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 17$
		
		$ \gamma_1 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_2 = 4 + 6 + 5 + 2 = 17$
		
		$  \gamma_2 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_3 = 2 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 16$
		\end{center}
		

		By simply changing the weight of $\gamma_6$ to $5$, we can illustrate all cycles are solutions to the BTSP. 
		
		\begin{center}

			$\gamma_1 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_3 = 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 17$
			
			$ \gamma_1 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_5 + \gamma_2 = 4 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 16$
			
			$  \gamma_2 + \gamma_4 + \gamma_6 + \gamma_3 = 2 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 15$
		\end{center}
		
		The computational complexity of the BTSP is shown to be NP-hard (reference.). Implying there is no algorithm for a solution in polynomial time. A brute-force approach would imply that we can run an algorithm in $O((N-1)!)$ time
	
		
		\subsection{Grover's Search Algorithm}

		\end{figure}
		
		In 1996, Lov Grover proposed a quantum algorithm for unstructured database search, that would provide at most a quadractic speedup (need ref). This speed up can be realized for suffiently large databases, but does not provide the exponential speedup promised by other quantum algorithms. We can refer to figure 2, to see the quantum circuit representation.
		A geometric representation of the algorithm as well as the two-qubit example will help us understand. 
		
		
		\begin{figure}[!h]

Starting from the uniform superposition $|s\rangle$, we perform a reflection over the orthogonal states of $|w\rangle$ with $U_w$. Then we perform a reflection over the superposition state $|s\rangle$ with $U_s$. we can see our new state $|x\rangle = U_sU_w|s\rangle$ is closer to the goal state $|w\rangle$. A new iteration, would imply reflecting again over $|w_\perp\rangle$ and then reflecting back over $|x\rangle$. b) An iteration performed on a 2-qubit system. Only one iteration is required to hit any goal state $|w\rangle$ }
			\label{fig:grovergeometric}. 
		\end{figure}
		
		
		\textbf{do i really need a two - qubit example in the figure? I dont refer to it in the text below at all. The kets are also not generating properly in fig 2, 3. Need to fix}
		
		Lets walk through one iteration of Grover's algorithm. Most quantum circuits are initialized at $|0\rangle$, then we apply the $H$ gate, this results in a uniform superposition:
		
		\begin{equation}
		 |s\rangle = H^{\otimes n} |0^{\otimes n} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n} |x\rangle
		\end{equation}
	%	$$ |s\rangle_2 = H^{\otimes 2} |0 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} (|00\rangle + |01\rangle + |10\rangle + |11\rangle)$$
		
		The orthogonal states to our goal state can be represented as the sum of all states not containing $|w\rangle$
		
		$$ |w_\perp\rangle=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n -1}} \sum_{x\in\{0,1\}^n}^{x \neq w} |x\rangle$$
		
		From here we apply the $U_w$ gate, for our reflection over the orthogonal states. This can be thought of flipping the sign onstate $|w\rangle$ contained within $|s\rangle$. We can see the visual representation in figure 3. We then perform a similiar reflection over the original state $|s\rangle$ :
		
		$$ U_w|s \rangle	=  (\mathbb {I} - 2|w \rangle \langle w|) |s \rangle = |s'\rangle$$
		$$ U_s|s' \rangle	=  (2|s \rangle \langle s| - \mathbb {I}) |s' \rangle = |s''\rangle$$
		
		Our $|s''\rangle$ is now closer to our goal state $|w\rangle$.  If we want to maximize our probability of measuring  $|w\rangle$, we will need to perform a number of iterations ($r$). For sufficiently large number of states, $N = 2^n$, we can make a few approximations to calculate $r$
		\begin{equation}
			\langle w | s \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} = \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \approx \frac{\theta}{2}
		\end{equation}
		
		
		$$P(w) = |\langle w | s \rangle|^2 = \frac{1}{N} = \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} $$
		
		$$P(w) = |\langle w |(U_sU_w)^r |s \rangle|^2 = \frac{1}{N} = \sin^2 (\theta(\frac{1}{2} + r)) $$
		
		to maximize the probability we need P(w) = 1, so we can set the inside of the sine function to $\pi/2$:
		$$ \theta \left(\frac{1}{2} + r \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}$$
		
		\begin{equation}
			r = \frac{\pi}{2\theta} + \frac{1}{2} \approx \frac{\pi}{2\theta}
		\end{equation}
		
		Using eqn. 2 to substitute $\theta$ in eqn. 3, we can get an approximate result for r
		
		\begin{equation}
			r \approx \frac{\pi}{4}\sqrt{N}
		\end{equation}
		
		
		\subsection{Quantum Phase Estimation Algorithm}
		
		Let's first briefly discuss the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Given a computational basis state $|x\rangle$, applying the QFT ($F_N$) results in:
		
		$$ F_N |x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} e^{2\pi i x k N^{-1}} |k\rangle $$
		
		let's represent this in binary notation and decompose it into a tensor product for some clarification.
		
		$$|x\rangle = |x_1x_2 ... x_n\rangle =  |x_1\rangle \otimes |x_2\rangle \otimes ... \otimes |x_n\rangle$$
		
		\begin{center}
		$$ F_N |x \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \bigotimes_{j=1}^n (|0\rangle +  e^{2\pi i x k 2^{-j}} |1\rangle)$$
		
		$$= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} ((|0\rangle + \omega_1|1\rangle)  \otimes(|0\rangle + \omega_2|1\rangle)\otimes ... \otimes(|0\rangle + \omega_n|1\rangle))$$
	    
	%	\begin{align}
		$\omega_1 = e^{2\pi i x 2^{-1}} =  e^{2\pi i (0.x_n)}$
		
		$\omega_2 = e^{2\pi i x 2^{-2}} =  e^{2\pi i (0.x_{n-1}x_n)}$
		
		$...$
		
		$\omega_n = e^{2\pi i x 2^{-n}} =  e^{2\pi i (0.x1...x_n)}$
	%	\end{align}
		
		An important characteristic of the $w_j$ is the bit shift occuring in the exponent. if we look at $w_1$, the exponent has a factor $x 2^{-1}$, which is equivalent to one right bit shift $x_1...x_{n-1}.x_n$.  We know that integer multiples of the exponent would imply full rotations returning to the same point thus we can ignore all the values on the left hand side of the decimal. 
		
		
	    \end{center}
		
		  Given an eigenstate $|\lambda \rangle$ of a unitary operator $U$, the phase estimation algorithm approximates a value for $\phi \in [0,1)$ satisfying:
		
		\begin{equation}
		 U |\lambda \rangle = e^{2\pi i \phi} |\lambda \rangle
	    \end{equation}
		\begin{figure}[!h]

			\includegraphics[trim={0 13cm 10cm 0},clip, width=0.99 \linewidth]{"graphics/phasr_circuit"}
			\caption{a quantum circuit representation of the phase estimation algorithm. $ U |\lambda \rangle = e^{2\pi i \phi} |\lambda \rangle $, we can  approximate a value for $\phi \in [0,1)$ .

		Let's walk through through the quantum circuit in figure 4, to understand the inner workings of this algorithm.	 Our initialized state is $|0^{\otimes n} \lambda\rangle$. From here we perform a the same operation we find in

		\section{details of proposed experiment/calculation}
		
		The goal is to implement a quantum algorithm that will calculate a solution for the BTSP in $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(N-1)!})$
		
		The challenge of this project is constructing $U_w$, this is sometimes referred to as the oracle. We gave a geometric explanation in the theory section, but lets discuss the structure of an oracle in depth. Given a function $f: \{0,1,...,N-1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$:
		
		\begin{equation}
			U_{w}|x\rangle = (-1)^{f(x)}|x\rangle = 
			\begin{cases}
				-|x\rangle & \text{for  $x=w$ }\\
				|x\rangle  & \text{for $x\neq w$}\\
			\end{cases}       
		\end{equation}
		
		\textbf{how would this oracle change, since there are no unique solutions as illustrated in the theory section?}
		
		\textbf{this section needs a lot more work, hoping it is more in depth once i understand QFT / phase estimation. This would imply the theory section would grow as well.}
	
		\textbf{the discussion of $U_w$ might be better suited in the theory section?}
		
		%We need to encode our max edge costs per cycle into the domain of our function f(x). We then need to construct a matrix, $U_w$, that it will result in a $f(x) = 1$
